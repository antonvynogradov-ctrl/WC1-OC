# Work-case 1. Using Git in Team Work

## Purpose of the Work
This assignment aims to explore the Git version control system, understand its core features and commands, and set up a public repository for storing coursework related to the “Operating Systems” discipline.

## 1. Purpose and Use of Git
Git is a distributed version control tool that helps monitor file changes and support teamwork on projects. It enables several people to work on one project at the same time, maintains a complete change history, and simplifies managing file versions.

Key capabilities of Git:
- monitoring file modifications;
- enabling teamwork on projects;
- recovering earlier file versions;
- using branches for separate development;
- integrating changes from multiple contributors.

Common Git commands:
- `git init` — creates a new repository;
- `git clone` — copies an existing repository;
- `git status` — displays the current file state;
- `git add` — prepares files for committing;
- `git commit` — records changes in the repository;
- `git push` — uploads commits to a remote repository;
- `git pull` — downloads updates from a remote repository.

## 2. Definition of a Commit
A commit represents a recorded state of file changes at a certain moment. Each commit stores details such as the author, timestamp, and a message describing the changes. Commits make it possible to review change history and roll back to earlier versions when necessary.

## 3. Repository Creation
A GitHub account was created and a public repository was set up to keep all completed assignments for the “Operating Systems” course. This repository serves as a platform for collaboration and version tracking.

## 4. Report Publication
The initial team report for Work-case 1 was uploaded to the public GitHub repository in Markdown format. The presence of commits from all team members demonstrates joint participation in the work.
